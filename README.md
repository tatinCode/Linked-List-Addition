# Linked-List-Addition
Java program that takes 2 ints and adds them as a linked list

This Java program adds two large integers represented as strings by converting them into doubly linked lists <br>
and then performing digit-by-digit addition, similar to how you would manually add numbers on paper. The result is <br>
stored and printed as another linked list.<br>

<h1>Sample Input</h1>

123
456

```
result of A+B: 579
```
